Why did i decide to go into software development?

The funny thing about it is originally I wanted to go and study computer science and work physically with the compuers and componets, but that wasnt really my cup-o-tea. You see actually building software and making a product. application, or even a interface that can help make life a bit easier. The possibilities are endless with coding the amount of thinking and problem solving are just facinating to me and all thats in my mind is how can I use this to better my self and make something great with all thats in my head. I know that along this journey however the road my get tough and things might be frustrating, but I have the right mentality to push foward and even when that fails me I have my greatest cheerleader teling me trully can do this and I wouldnt be here giving it my all if it werent for her.
